    Drop paths (Stochastic Depth) per sample (when applied in main path of residual blocks).
    This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet, etc networks, however,
    the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form of dropout in a separate paper...
    See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956 ... I've opted for
    changing the layer and argument names to 'drop path' rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use
    'survival rate' as the argument.
